    "<h3> Introduction </h3>\n",
    "<p> For this project, the first task was to generate a path for a rover to follow utilizing either dynamic programming or reinforcement learning. In order to choose the \"best\" method to use, both methods were implemented independently to generate paths for the robot to track, and the results were compared to determine which method would be used to complete the project. </p> \n",
    "<p>Regardless of chosen method, the generated path was required to accomplish the following items:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The path must take the robot from the starting point [1,1] to the end point [9,9] </li>\n",
    "<li> The path must avoid any and all obstacles placed on the 10x10 grid </li>\n",
    "<li> The trajectory must be smooth and avoid sharp ($90^{\\circ}$) turns </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p> Once a smooth trajectory was been achieved, an observer was designed and tested; the resulting control was also analyzed to determine if it is optimal. "

    "<h3> Path Generation </h3>\n",
    "<p> As mentioned in the introduction, two methods of path generation can be used for this task; the first being dyanmic programming (DP) and the second being reinforcement learning (RL). While these two methods are both Markov decision processes (MDP), they are fundamentally different in terms of how the path algorithm is actually determined based on the environment of the robot<sup>1</sup>. Both approaches were applied to the task at first so they could be directly compared, but the algorithm utilized by reinforcement learning was unable to determine the path to navigate the environment in a reasonable amount of time when it contained the desired amount of obstacles. For this reason, dynamic programming was used to solve the task.</p>\n",

    "<h5> Environment Setup </h5>\n",
    "<p> Prior to testing the path generating algorithms, the initial environment, or \"course\", the robot is to traverse had to be created. As per the requirements of the project, this required the construction of a 10x10 grid with several obstacles for the robot to avoid. Obstacles were placed in such a way that the robot would have to interact with them to get to the end-point, in order to verify that the chosen algorithm worked properly.</p>\n",
    "<p> The environment that was built can be seen in the image below; it consists of seven obstacles of varying size, which were initialized on the gird using MATLAB. </p>"

    "<h5> Path Creation via Dynamic Programming </h5>\n",
    "<p>The algorithm utilized to generate the path for the rover follows the concepts of dynamic programming; the MATLAB code implemented was based on the code authored by Dr. Vivek Yadav<sup>2</sup> and modified to allow for a larger grid, as well as the appropriate initial [1,1] and end positions [9,9]. Correction of the initial postion was achieved by setting the value of x_agent and y_agent to [1] and [1], respectively, and the end point was set by correcting the values of x_goal and y_goal to [9] and [9], respectively. The larger grid also required modification of the function check_ind.m so that the algorithm was iterated for all index points, not just those set by the inital code; initial values would have stopped the iteration after 41 steps, due to the original grid being 4x4. The new 10x10 grid required 101 iteration steps in order to properly determine the path. Finally, the obstacle penalty values (labeled as Act in the program) had to be increased from the initial values, to compensate for the larger grid and properly generate the obstacles.</p>\n",
    "<p> Application of these changes provided the cost-to-go plot as shown below; here all the obstacles have a high cost to go so that the algorithm avoids the obstacles as it generates the path. As the robot apporaches the goal, the associated cost to go is lowered until the goal is reached.</p><br>\n",

    "<h3> Path Smoothing</h3>\n",
    "<p> While the generated series of waypoints does achieve the objective of avoiding obstacles and getting the rover from the start point to the end point, the path contains multiple sharp turns. In practive, these sudden and sharp directional changes would be difficult for certain vehicles, such as UAVs, to physically implement. In light of this, the generated path must be smoothed so that all the turns follow a gentle curvature. This is accomplished here using gradient descent, and including a buffer around the obstacles to ensure the rover successfully avoids them when it follows the new path.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Gradient Descent</h5>\n",
    "<p>The trajectory generated for the rover to follow can be smoothed by performing an optimization which minimizes the following general equation:</p><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In this equation, ${XY}_i$ represents the original $XY$ values at a certain index, $i$, and $\\hat{XY}_i$ represents the new $XY$ values for the smoothed trajectory at the same index point, $i$. The first term is used to minimize the distance between the original trajectory generated by dynamic programming and the optimized (smoothed) trajectory. The second term is a weighted by a factor, $\\alpha$, and is used to penalize sharp turns in the optimized trajectory. For gradient descent, the general equation is converted to the form of:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{XY}_{i} = \\hat{XY}_{i} + \\beta (XY_{i}-\\hat{XY}_{i}) + \\gamma (\\hat{XY}_{i-1} - 2 \\hat{XY}_{i} + \\hat{XY}_{i+1})$$\n",

    "<p> The new path generated for this particular task is subject to boundary constraints; the constraints here are the start point, the end point, and obstacle buffers. The starting point is defined as $\\hat{XY}_1$, which is equal to the start point of the orginal trajectory, ${XY}_1 = [1,1]$. Similarly, the ending point of the smoothed trajectory, defined as $\\hat{XY}_N$, must end at the same point as the orginal trajectory, ${XY}_N = [9,9]$. All remaining waypoints (in the range of $i = 2:N-1$, where $N$ is the number of points in the original trajectory) within the smooted trajectory are determined using the gradient descent equation, and the constraints set by the obstacle buffers. Obstacles buffers will be analyzed between 0.1 and 0.3 units (with a step of 0.1 units), and are required here due to the fact that there is nothing else preventing the optimized path from overlapping with the defined obstacles.</p>\n",
    "<p> Prior to setting the buffer constraint on the path, the gradient descent algorithm was tested to ensure that it worked as desired. As previously mentioned, here $\\alpha = 0.1$ and $\\gamma = 0.5$.

Since the distance traveled between each point is known, the velocity can be used to determine the amount of time it takes to travel between each waypoint. Once the time required to travel between each point was determined, spline interpolation was used to equidistantly space waypoints on the trajectory. The results of this conversion can be seen on the plot below.</p>\n",

Therefore, the controller gain must be determined before the observer gain. The gain matrix, $K$, can be determined by picking random poles which force all eigenvalues of $A-BK$ to have negative, real parts, but this does not guarantee optimal control. Optimal control can only be achieved when an optimal gain matrix is utilized, which is why LQR was used here to determine $K$.</p>\n",

However, there are small fluctuations in the convergence as time passes, and peaking phenomena can be observed initially, therefore a reduced order observer should be implemented in future interations.</p>\n",

    "<p> In order to verify the output from the observer is correct, the estimated measurements were plotted to be compared to the trajectory. If the estimated valus mimic the desired trajectory, the observer is functioning as intended and will provide accurate data to the controller. As seen in the plot below, once the position error from the observer converges shortly after 1 second, the estimated measurements behave as desired, so the observer is of sound design. It should be noted that the measurement estimates do not start at the desired initial x and y location, but instead start at [0,0]. Implementation of a reduced order observer would better address this issue, further confirming future iterations should incorporate a reduced order observer.</p>\n",

    "<p> Once the estimation of $e_{ref}$, denoted as $\\hat{e_{ref}}$, is available, a simple controller can now be implemented to actually drive the rover along the desired path by the implementation of the control law, $u = -K \\hat{e_{ref}}$. In this law, the gain matrix, $K$, is the optimal gain matrix, $K_{opt}$ as determined by LQR. Implementation of the control law to the system dynamics using the estimated states, $ \\hat{e_{ref}}$, resulted in the following plots.</p>\n",

    "<p> As can been seen from the plot of the control input versus time, the intial control input required is larger than desired and is unattainable by the system; this is due to the lack of convergence and error from the observer's estimates. Once the observer error is converged, the control signal stays between the desired range of $-1 \\leq u \\leq 1$. This error could be partially corrected by implementing a reduced order observer, which would have no error for the position estimates, as well as adjusting the controller and observer gain values until desired control input is attained."

    "<h5> Function & Script Overview </h5>\n",
    "<p> This project utilized one main MATLAB script, and a variety of functions to complete the assigned tasks. In order, the main script implements the following functions and completes the task as follows:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> <strong>Path Generation</strong> - In order to generate the path, the user must define the grid size (grid_x & grid_y), the x & y starting locations, the x & y ending postions, the obstacle locations and the buffer size. These variables are utilized by the \"genPath\" function, to determine the path the robot should take to avoid obstacles.</li>\n",
    "<li> <strong> Path Smoothing </strong> - The path generated by the \"genPath\" function is not smooth and would be difficult for an autonomous vehicle to follow in practice. To achieve a smooth path via gradient descent, the \"smoothPath\" function is applied. This function utilizes the waypoints generated by the \"pathGen\" function and produces a new path with smoothed curves to allow the robot to follow the path easily. Buffers are included around the obstacles in the \"genPath\" function, which ensures that the smoothed path will not cross the obstacles.\n",
    "<li> <strong> Time Trajectory </strong> - The smoothed path is no more than a series of repositioned way points derived from the original path, so it is not possible for a designed controller to actually track this without converting to a time trajectory. Utilizing the knowledge that the total velocity of the rover is 1.5 units/s, the generated waypoints are converted to time dependent position vectors by the \"pointToTrajectory\" function. Spline interpolation is implemented to redefine the position and time vectors so they are equidistantly spaced.</li>\n",
    "<li> <strong>Observer & Controller Design</strong> - To determine the optimal gain for the controller, the function \"LQR_K\" is utilized, which simply applies the Ricatti equation to the user defined A, B, Q and R equations to determine the optimal gain matrix. The function \"fullStateObs\" is used to design a full state observer, based on the user defined poles and various system matrices, as well as the desired path coordinates. The function calculates the observer gain matrix and provides the state estimation needed for the controller.</li>\n"
